## Terminology

The documentation uses some terminology that is good to know and understand.

#### Cluster

A group or groups of systems managed and run uniformly. Types of clusters include HPC, CPU or render farms, parallel storage, web server farms, database and "big data" clusters, etc.

#### Diskless

When no hard drive is present in the node. Not to be confused with stateless!

#### HPC (High-Performance Computing)

Typically used to define a particular type of computing utilizing a system larger then the typical personal computer and used for some form of system intensive processing. These maybe either a cluster like system or a large shared memory resource.

#### Stateless

A system that has no persistent operating system storage between boots (e.g. originates from hard drives being the persistent storage mechanism). Stateless nodes do not necessarily imply diskless!

#### VNFS (Virtual Node File System)

The file system template or image used for for booting many systems

#### VNFS Image

This is the actual operating system image that will be provisioned to a system

#### VNFS Template

A directory that contains all of the operating system components that will be used as a template to create the VNFS Image
