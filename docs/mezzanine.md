# Mezzanine

Mezzanine is a packaging utility which is used to turn a package distribution into RPMS (or DEB packages). The Warewulf developers use it to assist with development but it also facilitates the process of building the binary RPMS.

You can download Mezzanine RPMS from:

*  [http://warewulf.lbl.gov/downloads/mezzanine/](http://warewulf.lbl.gov/downloads/mezzanine/)

After downloading the Mezzanine RPM you can install it with the following command:

```
$ sudo yum install mezzanine-1.9-0.24.x86_64.rpm --nogpgcheck
```
